## Contribute
I'm hoping the community can help do translations of different languages while I focus on ironing out the coding.
If you're interesting in doing translations:

- Take a look at my [WIP translation to Traditional Chinese](Languages/Chinese%20Traditional)
- Each line is one component translation
- Each line starts with the **EXACT** English full name of the component
- An equal sign '=' directly follows the English full name, without any spaces in between
- The translation directly follows the equal sign '=', without any spaces in between
- '[Optional]' The English full name is placed in brackets '( )' after the translation
- The last line in the file follows the format '*Translator*="Translator's Name"'
- Do a pull request if you've done some translations; alternatively, send the translations to [me](https://github.com/v-xup6) thru email

As this is a side project I'm doing on my own, any contribution is and will be highly appreciated.
